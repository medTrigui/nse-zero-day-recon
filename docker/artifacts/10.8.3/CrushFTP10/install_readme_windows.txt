Windows Java Install Instructions
---------------------------------
We recommend OpenJDK 21 and above.
If you didn't download CrushFTP with Java, download Java here:
https://jdk.java.net/archive/

Take the zip file and unzip it to its own folder named "Java" in your CrushFTP folder.
Example:
CrushFTP10\Java\bin\
CrushFTP10\Java\conf\
CrushFTP10\Java\lib\
etc...and other folders.
.........

The CrushFTP.exe will automatically search for this folder when launching CrushFTP.

If you have any troubles, contact support@crushftp.com.
